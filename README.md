# Mintlify Landing Page Clone

This project is a **desktop-first visual recreation of the Mintlify documentation landing page**, built strictly using **HTML and CSS only**.  
The goal of this project is to replicate the **layout, typography, spacing, and visual hierarchy** of the original Mintlify website as closely as possible.

> ⚠️ This project focuses on **UI structure and visual accuracy**, not interactivity or backend functionality.
